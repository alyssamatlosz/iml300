                This is the website for my favorite tea shop. I had never been on the website before this, but their storefronts have a very consistent and specific aesthetic that I assumed would be replicated online. I chose this as my good typography example for the usability of the menus, clear hierarchy of text using both different fonts and bolding, and for the spacing/layout of the text which says a lot without overcrowding the page.

                This is a website that a youtube vlogger made 13 years ago. I do not watch all of his videos, but after watching the one where he talked about this website, its horribly designed image was forever ingrained in my memory. A lot is to be said about the design of the website but to speak solely of the typography - the text color makes it barely readable at some points, the left align is poorly used, the section headers, despite being bold, are smaller than the body text, and the menu has no custom design at all.
